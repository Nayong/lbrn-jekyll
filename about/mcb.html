<h4>MCBC Rationale</h4>
<p>
  The main goal of the MCBC core is to provide access to the sophisticated equipment and expertise of the biomedical research institutions in the state, with the LSU flagship campus in Baton Rouge being the primary site, to train and support all INBRE investigators and to help them develop technological assays needed in their projects. An additional important goal of the MCBC is to assist PUI campuses to develop their own core facilities.
</p>

<br>

<h4>MCBC Organization</h4>

<p>
  The MCBC is a jointly operated core with the existing Molecular ImmunoPathology (MIP) core of the LSU COBRE Center for Experimental Infectious Disease Research (CEIDR). This Core is located within and administered by the Division of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine (BioMMED) at the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Kousoulas serves as the BioMMED Director and the Principal Investigator of the COBRE-CEIDR. As the Director of the MCBC and a member of the INBRE Steering Committee, he provides a strong linkage between the two Centers.
</p>

<p>
  The integration of the LSU COBRE MIP Core and the INBRE MCBC under the direction of BioMMED effectively leverages and expands the available resources and expertise of each unit and synergistically enhances the function of the two cores, while minimizing the duplication of equipment and services and associated costs.
</p>

<p>
  Although BioMMED is expected to provide the bulk of training and support to PUI investigators, the MCBC will continue to coordinate and facilitate research access and MCBC-related support provided by other centralized facilities in the LSU system and elsewhere in Louisiana to structure the greatest possible intellectual platform upon which innovative and creative ideas will merge with state-of-the-art technologies.
</p>

<p>
  The MCBC also involves three other COBREs. Of particular interest to current projects is access to cores spearhead by three other COBRE Centers housed at the PBRC in Baton Rouge (Gettys, PI), the LSU Stanley S. Scott Cancer Center in New Orleans (Ochoa, PI), and the LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, LA (Oâ€™Callaghan, PI).
</p> 

<p>
  Importantly, BioMMED/MCBC/MIP has designated specific wet-lab space at the LSU-SVM to be used by PUI investigators while they perform experiments in MCBC or accessing the near-by PBRC Facilities. This strong cross-utilization of INBRE-COBRE resources is consistent with NCRR programmatic goals that effectively enhance state-wide research competitiveness in the biomedical sciences.

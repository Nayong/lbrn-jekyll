**Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN)** was established in September 2001 with Biomedical Research Infrastructure Networks (BRIN) funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) Grant P20RR016456, the LBRN is committed to raising the research competitiveness of Louisiana researchers. IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) is the second phase of the BRIN Program when LBRN initially started. Currently, LBRN is in the third phase with continued funding by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Grant 8P20GM103424 and the Louisiana Board of Regents Support Fund.

<h4>BBC Rationale</h4>
<p>
  The importance of Computing in Biology and other sciences cannot be exaggerated. The challenge is not to just use Computing, but how to use computing effectively so as to be utilized and integrated with mainstream Biological Sciences. This challenge can be addressed at three different levels: Physical Infrastructure, Software/Services and finally Computational Training and Support. These three components collectively make up Cyber-infrastructure. We will show progress that the BBC has made in each of these areas, and then go on to discuss how we plan to extend and enhance our efforts along these directions as well as new ones, by effectively leveraging ongoing activities in our institutions and in the State.
</p>

<h4>Specific Aims</h4>
<p>
  To support the research efforts and activities of all LBRN project investigators by providing access to national, state and local high-performance computing, computational resources, expertise and support. The two sub-cores described below will work together to meet the goals of this specific aim.
</p>

<br>

<h4>BBC Organization</h4>
<p>
  The BBC has two sub-cores:
  <ul>
    <li>Cyberinfrastructure and Computational Services</li>
    <li>Classical Statistical and Data Mining Consulting sub-core.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Cyberinfrastructure and Computational Services Sub-Core:</h4>
<p>
  A balanced, integrated and usable Cyber-infrastructure requires more than physical infrastructure and software (services); it requires the people with expertise to make all these disparate components work together towards solutions for focused scientific problems; it requires the integration of the different components so that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and thus provides effective resources for real-production science and scientific aims. It is therefore critical to have the right people available to help, guide as well as develop the “last-mile” services that make the physical computational infrastructure effective and usable for scientific discovery and inquiry. The first steps towards realizing these goals have been taken; for example, the establishment of the Cyberinfrastructure Development Group at the CCT aims to bridge this missing link between physical infrastructure and end-user requirements. A specific example of such development is the LBRN Bio-portal, which provides the end-user with the ability to utilize multiple distributed LONI resources, without the burden of managing multiple resources directly. The LONI Institute can be considered a version of CyD scaled up to provide the same services at the State-level. The BBC of LBRN is strongly coupled to both the CyD and LONI Institute groups both at the management level as well as technically.
</p>

<h4>Classical Statistical and Data Analysis Consulting Sub-Core:</h4>

<p>
  Statistical consulting in support of biomedical experimentation is a requirement for sound experimental science and results that is often deficient or lacking altogether in many research environments, in particular at most of the PUIs engaged in this INBRE grant. Comments on submitted manuscripts from reviewers and the statistical editors of biomedical journals to INBRE mentees are ongoing evidence of this. Frequent and persistent errors of statistical practice exist in the biomedical literature and continue to occur. Biostatistics personnel at the LSUHSC-NO have provided NIH RO1 level and NIH-NCRR COBRE investigators with statistical consulting support for more than 20 years. These Biostatistics faculty members, including Hilary Thompson of the BBC directorate, are willing to collaborate to share expertise and resources between the current LSUHSC-NO COBRE programs (Center of Excellence in Oral and Craniofacial Biology, Mentoring Translational Researchers in Louisiana, and Mentoring Neuroscience in Louisiana) biostatistics core directors and the LBRN BBC biostatistics consulting services. Additionally the current INBRE funded project has trained the next generation of data mining scientists and data analysts at PUI campuses who can provide valuable expertise, experience and training to new junior investigators. Significant intellectual resources, including algorithmic tools, peer-reviewed manuscripts and web services have been designed and developed as a result of these efforts. Additionally, Post-Doctoral fellows will be hired in the interdisciplinary areas supported by BBC. We will include these resources along with the statistical consulting services to create a unique statistical and Data Mining Consulting virtual facility as a part of the LBRN project.
</p>

<p>
  This expanded function of the BBC builds on previous experience in interacting with project investigators over the years of the previous Louisiana INBRE grant. We plan to provide statistical and data mining consulting support for experimental planning and design, power requirement analyses, data management, manipulation and storage problems, as well as providing statistical analysis and training in these areas. This support, drawing on the resources of the combined LBRN BCC and COBRE statistical cores, will include application of standard methods used in statistical practice, but where required and motivated, also the development of novel methodology for statistical tests and interval estimation methods and their performance evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  Thus the BBC statistical consulting service reaches beyond the everyday practice of statistical consulting and, drawing on wide faculty expertise in the development of statistical methods, will add to the methods available for particular biomedical inference problems. The data analysis consulting experts of the BBC will conduct statistical methods research as well as the biostatistics graduate student training that is related to development of novel methodology. In the previous Louisiana INBRE Grant, two graduate students in biostatistics at the LSUHSC-NO School of Public Health were supported as assistants in this statistical consulting practice. Both previous students, supported as workers at the masters degree level have now entered the Ph.D. program in Biostatistics at LSUHSC-NO School of Public Health and will join the workforce of academic and industry statisticians and statistical consultants trained in biomedical statistical practice and method development. In addition to statistical consulting practice for biomedical science, the BBC will also draw on the growing expertise of PUI faculty mentored in the previous grant cycle.
</p>

<p>
  Dr. Sumeet Dua, Dr. Marjan Truschl, and Dr. Urska Cvek, all previously mentored PI’s of Louisiana INBRE projects in the BBC, and developers of novel methodology and tools for data mining and data visualization, will join the BBC and contribute the skills and methods they developed as mentees to serve the next generation of LBRN project PI mentees. The expertise contributed by these new members of the BBC extend the conventional statistical methodology available from the biostatics BBC section to newer data analysis methods including Data Mining, and novel methods for data visualization. Thus, the BBC will provide unique opportunities for the growing cadre of analytic expertise at the LBRN PUIs and at the flagship institutions to combine with LBRN Project PIs This new working relationship will help accomplish breakthrough research in data analysis and knowledge discovery to compliment research in biomedical science and computational methods carried out in collaboration with the new LBRN projects.

		<h4><strong>A new conference, ArkLaTex Interdisciplinary Cell Conference or ArkLaTex ICC for short, is being held here at LSUS on Saturday November 5th, 2016 from 9:00 AM until 4:00 PM.</strong></h4>
		<p>
			Students across all STEM disciplines will have the opportunity to apply their research and discoveries towards cell biology. The topic will focus on using interdisciplinary approaches to solving today's cell and molecular biology questions, ranging from bioinformatics to biochemistry. The primary goals of the 2016 ArkLaTex ICC will include practicing collaboration techniques while optimizing poster and oral presentation skills. Combined with emphasizing the importance of a balanced hypothesis and controlled experiments the students and post-docs will leave the conference with a larger knowledge base to carry themselves to national level conferences, grant submissions, and article writing.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are inviting all students, post-doctoral graduates, and principal investigators to present a poster. All of the abstracts, posters, and oral presentations submitted will be critiqued and positive feedback will be sent to all participants. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The keynote speaker will be Dr. Marisela Rodriguez, PhD from the CDC. Dr. Rodriguez currently works in the influenza lab. All investigators across the disciplines are invited and welcome to attend. Our theme for 2016-2017 is "Cohesion across the disciplines". Come and collaborate with us!

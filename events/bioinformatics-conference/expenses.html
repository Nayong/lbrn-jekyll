    First, register for the workshop. If lodging is needed please indicate on the registration form. We have reserved a block with Hyatt Place off I-10 on Bluebonnet Boulevard. Terri Gilbert, our Administrator, is managing the block registrations. You must follow up with her to make sure you're on her list by the deadline of May 1st to have a room reserved that LBRN will pay for. Otherwise, the hotel amount can not be covered by LBRN. Incidentals are the participant's responsibility.

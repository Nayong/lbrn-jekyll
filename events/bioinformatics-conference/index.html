    The Second Annual Louisiana Bioinformatics Workshop will be held on May 15-16, 2014 at the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT), LSU Baton Rouge.
  </p>
  <p>
    The workshop is sponsored by the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN), CCT and the LSU-Tulane Center for Experimental Infectious Disease Research. The main goal of the workshop is to provide a platform for exchange of information and technical knowledge among Louisiana-based scientists involved in different aspects of bioinformatics. The workshop includes plenary speakers and specialized technology-based presentations on next generation sequencing, advanced molecular and bioinformatics tools. The goal of the workshop is to facilitate exchange of practical information and facilitate future collaborations among attendees. Participants must register for the workshop, since there will be limited seating capacity. Most abstracts can be submitted for poster presentation. Topics include but not limited to: Bionformatics, molecular modeling, next generation sequencing, genomics, proteomics, phylogenetics, protein structure and function, etc.

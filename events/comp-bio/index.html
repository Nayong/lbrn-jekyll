				<h3>About The Seminar Series</h3>
				<p>
				The primary goal for the seminar series is to increase student awareness of the importance of computational approaches to modern biological research.  Traditional biology majors may receive no exposure to computational techniques, yet such skills are fast becoming de facto requirements for many careers in the life sciences.  Conversely, majors in computational disciplines may receive little or no exposure to modern biological research that would make them aware of the pressing biological problems to which their skills could be applied.  We hope that this seminar series...
					<ol>
						<li>Encourages students to take classes, do research, and seek out resources that allow them to cross the boundaries between biology and computation</li>
						<li>Raises awareness of the computational biology research being done at LSU and around Louisiana</li>
						<li>Encourages biology students to consider careers that leverage computational methods</li>
						<li>Encourages students in computational disciplines to consider careers in biological research.</li>

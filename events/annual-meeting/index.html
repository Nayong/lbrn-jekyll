	Each year the LBRN program has an annual meeting in which program participants, committee members and administrators meet to review individual research accomplishments and to discuss the overall program activity. Summer research faculty and graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to present their LBRN sponsored research, and talks are scheduled to highlight sponsored research projects from partnered campuses across the state. This year's meeting is being held on January 18-20, 2014 at the LA Tech University Hall.

	<em>For presenters, INBRE Project PIs, and Pilot Project PIs, 2013 LBRN Summer Faculty, and Graduate Students are required to submit an abstract to participate during the LBRN 11th Annual Meeting.</em>

title: Annual NIH Visit Week - Opportunity for Students
author: LBRN
---

NIH has an opportunity for students to apply to attend the annual NIH Visit Week (July 11-15, 2015), a one-week summer enrichment program to expose Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students to the NIH and to biomedical research and healthcare careers.  Selected students will participate in science career workshops, interactions in selected NIH laboratories and clinical research settings, a science journal club, informational interviews and professional networking opportunities throughout the week.  They will also attend the NIH Graduate and Professional School Day, meet with students in the NIH SACNAS Chapter, and learn about NIH internship opportunities.
 
To get the most of this program, students should have a strong interest in learning more about science careers.  NIH welcomes applications from students enrolled in Tribal colleges, and undergraduate college students at all levels.  All students who apply must be affiliated with our LBRN INBRE program.  Travel and accommodation costs will be the responsibility of the student or the associated INBRE grant.  
 
Activities will begin on 9:00 am on July 11, 2016 and activities will end at 3 pm on Friday, July 15, 2016.  Note: NIH is unable to accommodate students who need to arrive after the start of the program or leave before the end of the program.
 
The students should complete a brief online application at [https://www.training.nih.gov/sas/_20/903/][1] to be eligible for selection to attend the NIH Visit Week.  The application includes the student’s contact and school information, and a cover letter explaining his/her motivation for applying.  The student should select “INBRE” under “Your Affiliation” under “Education History” in addition to referencing INBRE in the cover letter.  The student should also include the name and email address for a reference.  An automated email will be sent to the reference listed by the student with instructions on how to submit the reference letter explaining why the student will benefit from the program.  To NIH - Applications are due Friday, April 22, 2016 and accepted students will be notified by May 13, 2016.

We look forward to welcoming your students to the NIH in July!

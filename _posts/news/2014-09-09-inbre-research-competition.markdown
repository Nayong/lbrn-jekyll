The selection and distribution of these projects by the Steering Committee will be based on the quality of the proposals and the needs of the INBRE program. Proposed projects should be consistent with the programâ€™s focal research areas.

The Online Form is closed as the deadline for the Letters of Intent has been reached. If you completed the initial form, you will have received an email with instructions. *This year we're using an online submission system instead of emailing completed proposals.*

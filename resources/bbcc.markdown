## What is the BBC Core?

The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core (BBCC) of the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) serves to train and support project investigators and their teams across Louisiana, and to lead and support translational research activities at the frontiers of biomedical science. Its team uses both established and custom computational tools, operating at computational scales ranging from the mundane to analyses engaging many hundreds of compute cores.

The BBCC is divided into four subunits, led by faculty and staff across four Louisiana campuses. The Cyberinfrastructure and Biomedical Data Analytics (CBDA) subunit supports the use of high performance computing (HPC) and the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI), and enables primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) investigators to conduct research engaging biomedical “big data” (e.g., genome-scale sequence alignment). The Biomedical Data Mining and Biostatistics (BDMB) subunit focuses on creating advanced data mining algorithm solutions to analyze large biomedical and biological datasets. The Biomedical Visualization and Interaction (BVI) subunit enables display and interaction (including synchronous distributed interaction) with biomedical data, which is crucial to actionable engagement with large biomedical datasets. Finally, the Communications Infrastructure and Training (CIT) subunit, jointly operated with the Administrative Core and the Molecular and Cell Biology Resources Core, supports synchronous and asynchronous video communication across LBRN, including facilitating a variety of training activities.

The BBCC and its subunits focus on three specific aims. First, led by CBDA with CIT contributions, BBCC will maintain and enhance the established cyberinfrastructure and provide computational resources expertise and support to all PUI campuses. Second, CBDA, BDMB, and BVI will equally contribute to provide bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational biology services to PUI investigators, and leadership and support for translational biomedical research. Finally, with coordination by CIT, all BBCC personnel will collaborate to provide organized training and educational support in bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computational biology to LBRN PUI faculty, staff, and students. These training efforts include workshops, seminar broadcasts and archives, poster events, teleconferences, and ad hoc training.

## Project Narrative

The Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, and Computational Biology Core (BBCC) serves to train and support project investigators and their teams across Louisiana. It is structured around four subunits that work together to enable Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN) project PIs and their teams to employ Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (especially high performance computing), and to provide bioinformatics services, training, and educational support.

CBDA enables biomedical data research—especially for big biomedical data contexts—over Louisiana cyberinfrastructure (e.g., LONI networks and HPC clusters: Supermike-II, SuperMic, Queenbee-II, etc.). CBDA provides software solutions to PUI investigators who need to run big biomedical data applications (e.g. de novo genome assemblers and alignment tools, etc.) on HPC clusters.

BDMB focuses on creating advanced data mining algorithmic solutions to analyze large biomedical and biological datasets. The advent of automated data collection instrumentation and next-generation sequencing presents a growing need for data mining and scalable biostatistical techniques. Such biomedical data is typically heterogeneous, highdimensional, and complex. Traditional data analysis techniques underperform as a consequence of the computational challenges posed by data dimensionality and velocity. Validating results and inferences drawn from analyzing these large datasets also poses challenges, confounding establishment of significance in biological contexts. These factors pose a growing need for novel data mining algorithms and techniques that are scalable, reliable, and interpretable.

Visual analytics tools enabling the display and interaction with biomedical data are crucial to data exploration and actionable follow-up. The expertise contributed by the CBDA and BDMB subunits extends conventional statistical methodologies to newer data analysis methods including visual data mining and visual analytics of big biomedical data. The BVI subunit will support and extend visual analytics expertise at LBRN PUIs and peer BBCC sites.

A central objective and role of the overall LBRN project is bridging geographical distance to increase the effective critical mass, interchange, and impact of biomedical domain expertise. The CIT subunit serves a crosscutting enablement role between all three LBRN cores and the personnel of our PUI project teams.
